## Development

#### Building Unicode names dictionary
The dictionary for the Unicode names is not included in this repository, but can easily be built using the latest Unicode data:

1. Download desired version of `emoji-test.txt` from http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/
2. Move `emoji-test.txt` to the same directory as `namesExtractor.py`
3. Run `python namesExtractor.py` in a terminal

`names-dict.js` will be created in `./addon`.


#### WebExtensions
This add-on was written as a WebExtension. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) has some good resources to help you get started.
